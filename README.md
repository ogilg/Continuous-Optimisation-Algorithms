# Continuous-Optimisation-Algorithms
Implementation of some continuous optimisation algorithms using python and NumPy.

Root-finding 1 dimension:
- Interval Bisection
- NewTon's method
- Secant method

Root-finding d dimensions:
- Newton's method

Optimisation:
- Gradient Descent
- Polak-Ribiere
- Newton's method for optimisation (i.e. root-finding for derivative)
- BFGS (Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm)
